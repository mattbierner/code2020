Clear the line content to the right or left of the cursor.

I personally use `delete all right` all the time, especially for multi cursor operations. It is bound to <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>k</kbd> on MacOS. You can easily setup keybindings for the `deleteAllRight` and `deleteAllLeft` commands on Windows and Linux as well.
