Use the `Create manual folding range from selection` command in VS Code to fold arbitrary sections of your code. This is useful when you want to fold something that isn't included in smart folding or are working in a language/file without smart folding.

These folding ranges stick around even as you edit the file. Use the 'Remove manual folding ranges' command to clear them
