[Workspace trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust) helps you more safely work with projects you find online.

With workspace trust, new projects are open in restricted mode, which disables some potentially dangerous features + extensions. You can trust the workspace using the `Manage workspace trust` command to restore all functionality. Make sure you only do this if you trust where the project came from though!
