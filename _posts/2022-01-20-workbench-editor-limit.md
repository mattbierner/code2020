Editor limits cap the number editors that you can have opened at any one time. Once you hit the limit, older editor as closed when you open a new editor.

Relevant Settings:

- `workbench.editor.limit.enabled — Enable/disable editor limits
- `workbench.editor.limit.value — Set the number of editors that can be opened
- `workbench.editor.limit.perEditorGroup — Apply limits per editor group instead of across the entire window

Useful for keeping your workbench organized.
